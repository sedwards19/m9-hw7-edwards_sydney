I really struggled with trying to incorporate the Javascript into the Bootstrap framework I had on my navigation. I kept seeing in the console that the event listeners were present but wouldn't show the hover effect. This could have been becauase these buttons had ids on them. 

However, once I created the buttons outside of the Bootstrap framework, I had no issues. For that reason, I created the Find a Location and Order Now buttons separate to ensure I met the assignment's requirements. I would love to know how to incorporate your own Javascript if you have already used a Boostrap template.
